# Habit Tracker App Improvement Plan

Based on the AI Accountability Agent concept, this document outlines strategies to make the habit tracker app more polished and intuitive.

## Core Vision: AI Accountability Through Emotional Connection

The goal is to create an AI coach that acts like "a mini James Clear in your pocket" - focusing on emotional connection and understanding rather than just task tracking.

  - Time of day/week
  - Recent struggles or victories
  - Emotional state indicators
